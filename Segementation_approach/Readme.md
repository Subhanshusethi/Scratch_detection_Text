## Training Instructions

To start training from scratch, set the `LOAD_MODEL` value to `False` and run all cells in the notebook.

## Testing and Validation

For testing and validation:
- Specify the path to the model weights model_weights link.
- Set `LOAD_MODEL` to `1` for testing.

This will iterate through the dataset. Results will be saved in the "saved images" folder after each epoch, which is continuously updated.
